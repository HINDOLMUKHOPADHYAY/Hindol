<p style="color:blue;">I am a highly motivated and optimistic person. I am a go getter and always strive to achieve the highest possible in any task. I have always ranked first in my class

Competition. I am also a Natonal Level Football Champion. Besides, I have a passion for theatre. I have not only acted in a number of plays but I have also been associated with 
its organization - Bohurupee as well. I have received the Best Actor Award for my acting skills. In 2022, I was elected as the school Captain. Since then, I have shouldered all the responsibilities
